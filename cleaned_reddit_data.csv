"Just tell them clearly that they're being loud and that there's plenty of other places for them to go and talk and this isn't one of them, so they should leave. Don't yell but speak loudly enough to sound assertive so others can hear you too.

"Edited to revise the second paragraph so it actually makes sense: 

And to the kid who looked me in the face and said, “okay,” when I suggested he move the mouse he took back to its original machine and give the one not working to Information *but then walked away without so much as moving a finger to do either of those things*: I sincerely hope you learn to think about literally anyone else but yourself and act accordingly. *I wasn’t asking you to solve the widespread issue of non working mice you claim is plaguing the first floor computers (it isn’t, from what I can see), I was asking you to do something about the ONE you knew about.

"GW Law 3L here. While I largely agree with the other comment about US News having a vendetta against this school, GW is simply not doing well with placing graduates. The Career Center has been consistently disorganized since 1L, and DC is a hugely competitive market - for fuck's sake, we even have to worry about George Mason now. Many of my friends have yet to secure a post-grad offer, and I can't really say the school has done anything to help them. 

It's sad because GW Law really is a fantastic school. But this is a huge ratings drop, and I'm just glad I've already gotten my position and am heading out.

Edit: “The downfall of GW should be studied” is now the top comment on the Law School subreddit’s rankings post.",2024-04-09 12:38:05,gw law 3l here . while i largely agree with the other comment about u news having a vendetta against this school gw is simply not doing well with placing graduate . the career center ha been consistently disorganized since 1l and dc is a hugely competitive market - for fuck s sake we even have to worry about george mason now . many of my friend have yet to secure a post - grad offer and i can not really say the school ha done anything to help them . it is sad because gw law really is a fantastic school . but this is a huge rating drop and i am just glad i have already gotten my position and am heading out . edit : the downfall of gw should be studied is now the top comment on the law school subreddit s ranking post .,2,negative,2024-04-08,2
